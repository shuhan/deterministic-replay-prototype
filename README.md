# deterministic-replay-prototype
This is an experimental prototype exploring deterministic replay for distributed systems.  The goal is to reduce the time spent reproducing production failures by capturing dependency state and enabling selective replay.  This is not production-ready software. It was built to validate the architectural approach and developer experience.
